# Cpp-Notes
This is a compilation of my notes while I was learning Modern C++ starting from Year 2026's Feb/Mar.

Ensure that each file has the following formatting in the starting of the page:

/*
    Date: DD-MM-YYYY            Time: HH:MM AM/PM           Index: Incremental

                                Topic: "Name of the Topic"
